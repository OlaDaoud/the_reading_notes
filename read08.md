## Comparison operators: evaluating conditions 
comparison operators usually return single values of **true** or **false** . 

| = | is equal to |
| != | is not equal to |
| === | strict equal to | 
| !== | strict not equal to | 
| > | greater than | 
| > | less than | 
| >= | greater than or equal | 
| <= | less than or equal to | 

## Logical operator  
logical operators allows you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator.

## using while in loops

* This loop will continue to run for as long as the condition in the parentheses is true.

* When the loop has finished, the
interpreter goes to the next line
of code, which writes the msg
variable to the page.
