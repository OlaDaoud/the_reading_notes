# Computer Architecture and Logic
## How Computers Work:
### What Makes a Computer, a Computer?

Humans always used tools to help in manual work, the machines pioneers wanted to invent tools that help in thinking that do these tasks : 
 1. take input 
 2. store information
 3. process it 
 4. output the results

#### first Computers

They started out as huge basic calculators made of wood and metals. 

### Input 
you can give an input using : keyboard, mouse, camera, mocrophone and any other tools

### Storage and process
informations are stored in memory, the processor takes information from memory, manipulates using algorithm, then send it back to the memory.

### output
the output could be : photos, videos, texts, games, vr ... etc.

## Binary & Data
* How do we store and represent information uning electricity?
BIT : the electric on/off flow  can represent any two options ( the smallest information in computer)

more bits = more complex informations 

### Binary number system : 0 / 1 

the number posittion in binary systm is multiplied by 2 ( starting from the right to left)

1st = 1
2nd = 2
3rd = 4
4th = 8 

so number 9 in decimal = 1001 in binary : (4th)+(3rd)+(2nd)+(1st) = 8+0+0+1 = 9 

#### letters in binary system 

you can assign value for each letter 


| A  | 00001  |
| B  | 00010  |
| C  | 00011  |

* we can represent any word or paragraph as a sequence of numbers.

#### Images in binary system

each graphic on screen is  made out of pixels, each pixel has a color thatcan be represened with numbers.

### Sound in binary system

The sounds are vibrations which can be presented graphically as a waveform, any point in the waveform can be represented by numbers.

## Circuit and Logic

in order to process the input and get an output, computer needs to modify and combine the input signals using circuits. 

##### **simple Circuit**
 takes an electrical signal and flips it, give it 1 and it gives you 0 and so on . 
 * the signa that comes in is **NOT** the signal that comes out, so we call this circuit a **NOT**.

##### **Complicated Circuits**
takes multiple signals and combine them to give different results. if either of the signals coming in is a 0 then the result is 0. 
*  The Circuit will give you a 1 if the first **and** the second signals are both 1, so we call this circuit **AND**.

###### there are many small circuits that performs simple logical calculations.

Ex : Nor , or , nand ... etc


those circuits are **LOGICAL GATES**, by connecting them we can make more complex circuits 

For example: you can make a circuit that adds 2 bits together called an **adder**. It makes a sum 
the sum can be 0+0 = 00 , 0+1= 01 , 1+1=10 (2)

### Why smaller computers = faster ? 

the smaller circuits = less distance for the electrical signals to go.
