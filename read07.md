## How Javascript makes web pages more interactive ?

1. Access content
2. Modify content
3. Encompasses traditional rules of programming
4. Responding to what other users do

## The ABC of programming

### A what is a script and how to create one 

a script is a series of instructions.
* work on individual tasks that can be represented in flowchart
* Break each task into a sequence of steps.
* Translate steps into synatx in programming language

### Think like a computer

# Expressions

An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions : 

1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE 
2. EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE

## Operator
Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values. 

* ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS
Assign a value to a variable
``` color = 'beige';```
The value of color is now beige.

* ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
Perform basic math
```area = 3 * 2;```
The value of area is now 6.

* STRING OPERATORS
Combine two strings
```greeting= 'Hi 1 + 'Molly';```
The value of greeting is now Hi Molly.

* COMPARISON OPERATORS
Compare two values and return true or false
```buy = 3 > 5;```
The value of buy is false.

* LOGICAL OPERATORS
Combine expressions and return true or false
```buy= (5 > 3) && (2 < 4);```
The value of buy is now true.

## Functions 

### What is a function 

set of instructions grouped together into blocks. 
If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function.

### Declaring function

``` function name(params){ }```


### Calling a function

 ```function name();```

 ### Using expression 
 ```var showmore = function(  ) {   }```
